# gcp/airflow-tls walkthrough

A guide for using CNDI to deploy a GitOps enabled Airflow cluster on Kubernetes
in Google Cloud Platform

## overview 🔭

This walkthough uses the cndi CLI to create an pre-generated `gcp/airflow-tls`
template that builds a TLS-enabled Airflow application in a kubernetes cluster.
This template quickly and easily create all of the necessary components for a
complete cluster, such as a nodes, loadbalancer,and applications. Additionally,
it can be easily extended to include custom applications or manifests. By
choosing the `gcp /airflow-tls` template in the cndi cli you will create a
3-node cluster running TLS-enabled Airflow within minutes

## prerequisites ✅

**You will need the following things to get up and running with cndi
successfully:**

- **A GCP account and a GCP project**: cndi will deploy directly into valid
  [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) Project connected to a valid
  billing account

- **Your GCP service account credentials**: cndi will leverage your google
  cloud's **service-account-key.json**
  [credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to deploy
  resources.

- **A DNS registrar**: cndi creates a load balancer with the tls templates, so
  you'll need an attach the dns of the load balancer to the A record of your
  domain.

- **A GitHub account**: cndi manages the state of your infrastructure using a
  git-ops workflow, so you'll need an
  [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
  with a valid
  [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## download cndi ⬇️

Run the following command within your terminal to download cndi:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polyseam/cndi/main/install.sh | sh
```

> #### **Note** 💡
>
> _If you are on Windows, you should run this command in a Git Bash terminal._

## install cndi cli ⚙️

```shell
cndi install
```

## create your cndi repository 📂

cndi stores all your cndi cluster configurations within a Git repository.

Run this command within the directory that you want to store your configuration
in:

```bash
gh repo create my-cndi-cluster --private --clone && cd my-cndi-cluster
```

## creating cluster config with cndi templates using the interactive cli 🛠️

Run this command within the directory that you want to store your configuration
in:

```shell
cndi init -i
```

You will get an interactive prompt where you'll specify the template you want.
The template specified in this project is the `gcp/airflow-tls`

```shell
? Pick a template
   aws/basic
   gcp/basic
   aws/airflow-tls
 ❯ gcp/airflow-tls
```

Below is the Interactive prompt values are used to customize the user's cluster
configurations with the application.

- **Cndi Project Name**: name of project
- **Template**: _list of templates to choose from_
- **GitHub Username**: _a user's handle on GitHub._
- **GitHub Repository URL**: _place where your code is stored: a repository on
  GitHub_
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: _alternative to using passwords for
  authentication to GitHub_
- **GCP Region**: _region where the infastructure is being created_
- **Path to GCP service account key json**: gcp credentials for project
- **Git Username for Airflow DAG Storage**:_a user's handle on GitHub._
- **Git Password for Airflow DAG Storage**:_place where your code is stored: a
  repository on GitHub_
- **Domain name you want Argocd to be accessible on**: _domain where argocd will
  be hosted_
- **Domain name you want Airflow to be accessible on**: _domain where Airflow
  will be hosted_
- **Email address you want to use for lets encrypt:**

This process will generate a `cndi-config.json` file, and `cndi` directory at
the root of your repository containing all the necessary files for the
configuration It will also store all the values in a file called `.env` at the
root of your repository.

The structure of the generated templated project will be as follows:

```shell
├── 📁 cndi
│   ├── 📁 cluster_manifests
│   │   ├── 📁 applications
│   │   │   └── airflow.application.json
│   │   ├── argo-ingress.json
│   │   ├── cert-manager-cluster-issuer.json
│   │   └── git-credentials-secret.json
│   └── 📁 terraform
│       ├── x-airflow-node.cndi-node.tf.json
│       ├── y-airflow-node.cndi-node.tf.json
│       └── z-airflow-node.cndi-node.tf.json
├── cndi-config.jsonc
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── .github
└── README.md
```

## upload environment variables to GitHub ⬆️

Upload your environment variables in the .env file to the GitHub Actions
workflow This ensures that the workflow will have access to the necessary
environment variables when it is triggered.

```shell
gh secret set -f .env
```

![GitHub secrets](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/upload-git-secrets.png)

## deploy your templated cluster configration 🚀

Once all the config is created and environment variables are uploaded to GitHub,
add, commit and push the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git status 
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

You should now see the cluster configuration has loaded to GitHub:

![GitHub repo](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/github-repo.png)

Now, open your web browser and navigate to your project on GitHub. Click on the
Actions tab, then click on your current commit.

You will see something like the image below, which shows that GitHub has
successfully run the workflow.

![GitHub action](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/github-action.png)

It is common for `cndi-run` to take a fair amount of time, as is the case with
most Terraform and cloud infrastructure deployments.

Once `cndi-run` has been completed, you should be ready to log into AWS to
connect your application through the load balancer at the domain you specified
in the interactive prompt.

## attach the load balancer to your domain 🌐

- Go to [GCP network services console](https://cloud.google.com/net-services)
- In the navigation pane, choose **Load Balancing**
- Select the **Load Balancer** thats attached to your GCP Cluster
- Copy that Load Balancer's DNS **Addresses** (A record)

![Aws nlb](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/gcp-nlb.png)

Go to your custom domain, you will need to add a A record for your domain and
add the DNS Address of your load balancer to it

![google domains](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/google-domains-a-record.png)

## Connect to an node in your cluster 🤝

- In the navigation pane, choose VM Instances.
- Select a instance and click on the SSH button to connect

![Aws instances dashboard](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/gcp-instances-ui.png)

In order to login to Argocd, we have to get the password from within the cluster
Run the command below in the terminal of one of the cluster nodes:

```shell
sudo microk8s kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

save that password and then go to the Argocd domain URL that you specified in
the interactive prompt

You should now see a login page for Argocd, and a place to enter a username and
password. The username is `admin` and the password is the text you copied in the
previous step.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/argocd-ui-1.png)

Notice that the cluster_manifests in the GitHub repository matches config in the
Argocd UI

```shell
├── 📁 cndi
   ├── 📁 cluster_manifests
       ├── 📁 applications
       │   └── airflow.application.json
       ├────── git-credentials-secret.json
       ├────── cert-manager-cluster-issuer.json
       └────── argo-ingress.json
```

Verify all applications and manifests in the GitHub repository are present and
their status is healthy in the Argocd UI

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/argocd-ui-2.png)

## verify that Airflow is accessible on the chosen domain 🧐

After setting up your Airflow application on the chosen domain, it is necessary
to verify that Airflow is accessible. To do this, the user can simply go to the
chosen domain and see if they can see Airflow's login page. The default username
is `admin` and the password is `admin`. If the page is accessible, then the user
can log in and begin using Airflow. If not, the user wait, should go back and
make sure the previous steps were was done correctly.

![Airflow UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/airflow-ui-0.png)

## Verify Airflow is connected to the private DAG repository 🧐

Verify that Airflow is connected to the private dag repository. If correct, the
private dags should be visible on the Airflow UI. If not,you should go back and
make sure that the private dag repository is properly connected to Airflow with
the correct credentials

![Airflow UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gcp/img/airflow-ui-1.png)

## and you are done! ⚡️

You now have a fully-configured 3-node Kubernetes cluster with TLS-enabled
Airflow and Argocd

## destroying resources in the cluster! 💣

**If you just want to take down any of your individual applications:**

- Delete that application or manifest from your cndi-config.jsonc
- Run cndi ow
- Commit changes
- Push your code changes to the repository

**If you want to take down the entire cluster:**

- Delete all the files in your cndi/terraform directory
- Create an empty called destroy.tf in the cndi/terraform directory
- Commit changes
- Push your code changes to the repository
